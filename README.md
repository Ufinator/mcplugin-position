# McPlugin-Position
A self-made Minecraft "/position" Plugin <br>
It is available here: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/position.89357/
## About
This is my first self-coded open-source Minecraft plugin. With this plugin, you can save your position (as coordinates)
and if you want back to the saved position, you can call it and it will respond it with the coordinates.

## How does it work?
It's pretty simple: <br> <br>
Command to save your position: ```/position set {custom name}``` _It will announce everyone on the Server if a new
position will be created_<br> 
Permission: `None` <br> <br>
Command to get a saved position: ```/position get {position name}```<br>
Permission: `None`<br> <br>
Command to remove a saved position: ```/position remove {position name}``` <br>
Permission: `None` <br> <br>
Command to list all available positions: ```/position list``` <br>
Permission: `None`

## Supported Versions
This Plugin is made for the Version `1.16.5`. <br>
But it works also with these Versions: `1.8.X - 1.16.X`
